# Flappy_Kuromi

This is a game developed for the Graphic Computing course, inspired by the classic Flappy Bird.

The presented code is based on the following repository: [Flappy_bird_CV_Edition](https://github.com/KDSCRIPT/Flappy_bird_CV_Edition).
This version introduces significant changes from the original code, it also incorporates Mediapipe to enhance user interaction, but using the nose's position (tracked using face recognition), allowing Kuromi to follow the user's nose movements, additionaly there are alterations in the generation of the pipes and other enhancements.


I express my gratitude for the creative assets that contribute to the charm of this game:

- **Sanrio Art:** The delightful Kuromi character artwork is sourced from Sanrio, adding a touch of cuteness to the gaming experience.
- **Music Credits:**
  - **Main Menu Music:** [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_ENZmKx9Jg)
